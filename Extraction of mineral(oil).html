    <h1>Extraction of mineral(oil)</h1>
    <p>Usable petroleum can be drawn out from beneath the earth's surface from a designated area in many different ways with varying possibilities of the quality and resource amount from the extraction.</p>
    <p>Conventional oil is extracted from underground reservoirs using traditional drilling and pumping methods. Conventional oil is a liquid at atmospheric temperature and pressure, so it can flow through a wellbore and a pipeline â€“ unlike bitumen (oil sands oil) which is too thick to flow without being heated or diluted.</p>
